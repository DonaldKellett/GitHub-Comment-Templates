## For (public) Codewars solutions repositories

```markdown
From the [Codewars Community Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Codewars/codewars.com/wiki/Community-Code-of-Conduct):

> **Please do not post your solutions on Github.** We realize you would like to use these challenges as your resume, but you should have side-projects for that. If a Code Warrior is unable to find a solution online, then they are further encouraged to complete the task themselves - which will enable them to get more value out of their time spent.

Therefore, I would like to request for this repo to be made private, or at least state unambiguously in the README that:

- Codewarriors are strongly encouraged not to look at your solutions to Kata until they have completed it themselves or at least took the time to think about their own approaches
- Codewarriors should not submit your solutions as their own
- You will not be accepting contributions of any form to this repo
- Creating a repository like this is discouraged by Codewars

You are not obliged to abide by this request since this is your own work; however, cooperation on your part would be much appreciated.
